# AI Violation Log

This file tracks critical operational errors and guideline violations to prevent recurrence. Every entry must include the date, a description of the violation, the root cause, and the preventive measure implemented.

## RECURRING VIOLATIONS

### 1. Unauthorized Completion Marks
- **Status**: ACTIVE RISK
- **Description**: Marking tasks or roadmap stages as `[COMPLETED]` or `[DONE]` without explicit user authorization.
- **Root Cause**: Over-eagerness to show progress and "driving" the project instead of following the user's lead.
- **Preventive Measure**: Mandatory "STOP AND ASK" before any status update in `documentation/ACTIVE_TASK.md` or `tmp/refactoring_plan.md`.

### 2. Failure to use Private Database
- **Status**: MITIGATED (Guideline Updated)
- **Description**: Using the development database instead of the mandatory private Junie database (`JUNIE_PRIVATE_DB=true`).
- **Root Cause**: Defaulting to standard environment variables instead of strictly adhering to SNEA mandates.
- **Preventive Measure**: Updated `guidelines.md` to make `JUNIE_PRIVATE_DB=true` mandatory for ALL operations.
