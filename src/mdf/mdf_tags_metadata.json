This allows you direct control over line-breaks and spacing. Note the |{tab} bar-code in the above example. This tells Toolbox to insert a Tab at each of these places, when the file is formatted by MDF or exported to an RTF file. (Currently Toolbox does not support typing the Tab character directly.) Inevitably, your tables will require some \"tweaking\" in MS-Word before you print the dictionary.
